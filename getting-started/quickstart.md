In this lesson, you will learn the essential steps to get started with web development. First, we'll guide you through downloading and installing a code editor on your device, a crucial tool for writing and editing code. Next, you'll be introduced to the process of submitting assignments, ensuring you can easily share your work for review and feedback throughout the course.

### Installing A Code Editor

A **code editor** is a specialized software used by developers to write and edit code. It provides an environment where you can create, modify, and manage files written in programming languages like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and more. Unlike a regular text editor, a code editor often comes with features like syntax highlighting, auto-completion, and debugging tools that make coding easier and more efficient. **Visual Studio Code** (VSCode) is the most used Code editor Globally.

For this course the code editor you would be using would depend on your device.

* For Laptops / Desktop: VSCode
* For Mobile devices: Code Editor - Compiler & IDE
