# Introduction to HTML

#### Objectives:

* Understand the structure and purpose of HTML.
* Learn basic HTML tags (headings, paragraphs, links, images).

### What is HTML <a href="#what_is_html" id="what_is_html"></a>

HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is a _markup language_ that tells web browsers how to structure the web pages you visit. It can be as complicated or as simple as the web developer wants it to be.

We do this using code elements called \`tags\`.

```html
<p>Hello world!<p> <!-- This is a paragraph tag saying 'Hello world!' -->
```

The type of tag enclosing an HTML content determines how it would appear and act.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Note:** Tags in HTML are not case-sensitive. This means they can be written in uppercase or lowercase. For example, a [`<title>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/title) tag could be written as `<title>`, `<TITLE>`, `<Title>`, `<TiTlE>`, etc., and it will work. However, it is best practice to write all tags in lowercase for consistency and readability.
